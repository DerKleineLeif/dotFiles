Hi,

these are dot files that I use. Feel free to fork and use them for your self.
If they don't work for you don't blame me.
As always, I couldn't have done this alone, so thank you for your input

Greetings!

What to do after cloning?
for vim
	cd 
	mkdir .vimbackup
	ln -s dotFiles/vim/.vim 
	ln -s dotFiles/vim/.vimrc
